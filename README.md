# Experimental ES Lint Setup

- run `npm run install` (This command will install all the project dependencies in the node_modules including ESLint)
- run `npm run dev` (This command will run the project locally in development mode)
- run `npx eslint filename` (This command will show the errors in the file which are disobeying the rules)
- run `npm eslint filename --fix` (This command will try to auto-fix the errors if possible)
- You may also install `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` which is an ESLint extension. This will help in better development experience using ESLint.
